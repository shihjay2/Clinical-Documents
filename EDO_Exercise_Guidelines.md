**Provider Guidelines for Healthy Exercise in Eating Disorder Patients**

* Patient must be medically stable (HR > 50 and non-orthostatic by BP/pulse for a minimum of 2 consecutive visits)
* Patient must be asymptomatic with current exercise (no dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, palpitations, etc)
* Patient must be >= 90% minimal health weight
* If weight drops below 90% or patient is not progressing towards 100% of minimal healthy weight, exercises privileges must be decreased or discontinued
* Exercise should be done only once daily, and not immediately after eating.  Patient should take at least 1 day off from exercise each week.
* Encourage patient to exercise with a non eating-disordered friend or in a class setting.
* All physical activity should be considered exercise (ie wakling, working, shopping, cleaning) and should be monitored
* When all criteria for exercises are met, start with 15-20 minutes, 3x/week of light activity such as yoga, walking, Pilates, or light strength training.  If patient is tolerating exercise and maintaining physical criteria, exercise can be increased in time OR duration in gradual increments (eg, q2 weeks, add 10 more minutes to exercises time OR increase intensity).  If patient has a history of over-exercise, monitor carefully for attitudes and behaviors around exercise.  Check in with patient's motivations for exercise and encourage healthy motivations (reduce stress, improve sleep, socialize with friends while hiking, etc) rather than unhelathy motivations (burning calories, as "purging" to make up for eating, etc).
* For non-competitive athletes, do not exceed 60 minutes of exercise, 6 days/week.  If someone is comfortable exerciseing less, do not encourage them to increase exercise.
* No running or other high impact activities if patient has secondary amenorrhea, has just resumed menses, or has primary amenorrhea and in the doctor's estimation pt is physically mature enough to have started menstruating.
* DEXA scans need to be done annually; this is especially important for patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis. (Baseline DEXA scans should be edone on any patient with 6 months or greater of amenorrhea or chornic oligomenorrhea or delayed menarche)

**For Competitive Athletes:**
* When patient is at 100% of minimum weight for health and has had 3 consecutive menses (females) , then the type of activity may be liberalized to include high impact activities (eg ballet, basektball, soccer, running), BUT the number of hours should be resticted to 6-15 hours/week.  If the activity is less aerobic tahn dancing or gynmastics, the limit could be set at 12-15 hours/week.
* For males, testosterone levels need to be normal, and patient needs to be 100% of MWH in order to liberalize the type of activity and to go beyond 1 hr/day, 6 days/week.
